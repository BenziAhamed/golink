# GoLink

An [Alfred app](https://www.alfredapp.com) workflow to create and manage bookmarks.

## Adding a bookmark

Typing `go Google Home Page www.google.com` will create a bookmark titled `Google Home Page`.


## Searching a bookmark

The following actions will return your `Google Home Page` result as a bookmark:

- Typing `go google`
- Typing `go ghp`
- Typing `go gpage`

Anchored text searches are fully supported.

## Deleting a bookmark

`Cmd` + `click` on an Alfred result item after typing `go ` or `go <search query>`.

## Troubleshooting

### This does not work on Catalina!
Pretty sure you might face some issues; if so, refer this [issue with another one of my workflows](https://github.com/BenziAhamed/Menu-Bar-Search/issues/4) for a possible workaround. I don't have Catalina at the moment; I _may_ eventually code sign this.
